Today, Fontana Ermes honors the legacy of generations of Italian tradition in order to bring the finest cured meats - like this Italian prosciutto crudo - to your table. This 13 month aged, decadent product is made from the hand-selected legs of heritage breeds of hogs that are raised on the lush pastures and abundant produce of northern Italy's Emilia-Romagna region. The legs are expertly trimmed, then coated with a layer of sea salt to dry and preserve the meat. These salted legs are left to cure for 400 days in the perfumed sea breezes of the region, during which time the meat develops a complex, lightly sweet, and savory flavor, as well as a striking ruby-red color shot through with rich white marbling. This exquisite product is made without preservatives: high-quality ham, sea salt, fresh air, and time are the only ingredients used to make this prosciutto crudo, just as it has been made for centuries!\nIn Italy, prosciutto crudo is typically served uncooked, as opposed to prosciutto cotto, which is cooked. Thus, this prosciutto crudo is ready to eat straight out of the package! This rich, traditional meat will make a memorable addition to your next cheese plate or charcuterie board. Slice it into thin ribbons and pair it with hard Italian cheeses like Pecorino Romano or Grana Padano, as well as olives, figs, melon, and rustic bread for a delicious antipasto platter that your guests are sure to remember! When served with a glass of crisp white or complex red wine, this prosciutto crudo will offer a delicious taste of the best of Italy. Plus, while it's delicious on its own, this prosciutto makes a wonderful addition to any number of dishes on your menu! Add it to decadent sandwiches, where its rich flavor will enhance the taste of all of your other ingredients. It also makes a great topping for traditional Italian pizzas, especially when paired with melty mozzarella, brightly acidic tomato sauce, refreshing basil, and piquant arugula! Serve it alongside a plate of Tuscan tagliatelle and vegetables, or pair it with sauteed fresh asparagus or sweet peas. No matter how you choose to use it, this prosciutto crudo will impart the taste of centuries of Italian culinary tradition into your signature dishes!\nSince his childhood, Fontana Ermes's life has been steeped in the ancient Italian traditions of butchering and curing ham. As a boy, he traveled with his father to remote, rural farms to slaughter hogs for families' winter supplies; because ham was such an important staple in peasant families' diets, this important job had to be carried out with the utmost care and expert skill. As Mr. Ermes became more and more accomplished in the art of butchering, it seemed a natural step for him to begin a ham production facility of his own. In 1959, he began the Fontana Ermes company by curing 17 hams - and, as a testament to his skill, these hams were purchased before they were even finished curing! Today, Fontana Ermes is renowned throughout the world for producing first-class charcuterie and DOP Prosciutto di Parma that are made in their state-of-the art facility with a deep respect for centuries of Italian culinary history. Explore their line of exquisite cured and cooked meats to get a taste of the finest Italy has to offer!"

This product is cut from between the shoulder and back legs of the hog and is widely regarded as the leanest and most tender cut of pork available. Because the tenderloin is not a hard-working muscle, it doesn't develop dense connective tissue, giving it a melt-in-your mouth tender texture! Best of all, this bulk supply will keep you well stocked for all your culinary needs. Each case contains 6 bags, each containing (2) 0.8 lb. tenderloins for an approximate weight of 10 lb. total.\nThese whole tenderloins allow you the flexibility to choose how you prepare your meat. Whether you cut it into individual tenderloin steaks or cook it as a whole roast to carve at your butcher station, this pork tenderloin will allow you to create entrees that are sure to satisfy your guests! Try seasoning it with a delicious spice rub made with garlic, rosemary, fennel, sage, salt, pepper, and even ginger, or allow it to soak up the flavor of your signature marinade. When you're ready to cook, cover the loin loosely with foil and place it in an oven heated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook it until the internal temperature of the center of the roast reaches at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit, then remove the meat from the oven and allow it to rest before carving. Try serving individual pork steaks with a drizzle of demi-glace and a portion of sauteed wild mushrooms for a hearty and refined main course, or delight your guests by allowing them to watch your expert servers carve this whole roast by hand!"

Jamon Serrano is a traditional dry-aged Spanish ham made from hind pork leg meat from pigs that are fed a rich diet of acorns. While similar to Prosciutto, Spanish jamon Serrano is aged longer using a dry process that results in a more intense texture and salty flavor. During this curing period, the jamon develops a richly complex flavor that prominently features the smooth, distinctive taste of Serrano ham. The final result is a striking blend of pink and deep red marbled with melt-in-your-mouth, silky white fat that coats the mouth with the rich flavor of centuries of Spanish gastronomic tradition!\nThis jamon Serrano is a perfect addition to a Spanish-inspired tapas cheese plate! It comes pre-sliced, making it easy to serve it alongside other traditional Spanish meats like salchichon salami or chorizo, as well as Spanish cheeses like rich Manchego or distinctive Mahon. Adorn your cheese plate with other Spanish delicacies like salty queen olives, buttery marcona almonds, or sweet quince jelly, and serve it alongside a glass of rich Spanish red wine like Rioja or Jumilla - as they nibble and sip, your patrons will feel as though they are being warmed by the rays of the Spanish sun! Include it in rich, Spanish-inspired staples such as creamy croquetas or \"pan con tomate\" - crusty toast points rubbed with garlic, drizzled with olive oil, and topped with fresh, crushed tomatoes and slices of jamon Serrano. No matter how you choose to serve it, this jamon Serrano will make a deliciously traditional addition to your menu!\nSince 1999, Don Juan has been committed to honoring the legacy of traditional Spanish delicacies through careful production using time-honored methods. Each of their products is a love letter to the delicious flavor that comes from pride, careful craftsmanship, and patience. When you serve Don Juan products, your customers will fall in love with the rich traditional flavors that envelop their senses and engage their imaginations!"

Today, Fontana Ermes honors the legacy of generations of Italian tradition in order to bring the finest cured meats - like this thin sliced Italian prosciutto crudo - to your table. This decadent product is made from the hand-selected legs of heritage breeds of hogs that are raised on the lush pastures and abundant produce of northern Italy's Emilia-Romagna region. The legs are expertly trimmed, then coated with a layer of sea salt to dry and preserve the meat. These salted legs are left to cure for 400 days in the perfumed sea breezes of the region, during which time the meat develops a complex, lightly sweet, and savory flavor, as well as a striking ruby-red color shot through with rich white marbling. This exquisite product is made without preservatives: high-quality ham, sea salt, fresh air, and time are the only ingredients used to make this prosciutto crudo, just as it has been made for centuries!\nIn Italy, prosciutto crudo is typically served uncooked, as opposed to prosciutto cotto, which is cooked. Thus, this prosciutto crudo is ready to eat straight out of the package - it's already sliced thin, saving you valuable time in your kitchen! Plus, this conveniently sliced product allows you to serve authentic, delicious Prosciutto di Parma without purchasing a large piece of meat or a bulky meat slicer. This rich, traditional meat will make a memorable addition to your next cheese plate or charcuterie board. Pair it with hard Italian cheeses like Pecorino Romano or Grana Padano, as well as olives, figs, melon, and rustic bread for a delicious antipasto platter that your guests are sure to remember! When served with a glass of crisp white or complex red wine, this prosciutto crudo will offer a delicious taste of the best of Italy. Plus, while it's delicious on its own, this prosciutto makes a wonderful addition to any number of dishes on your menu! Add it to decadent sandwiches, where its rich flavor will enhance the taste of all of your other ingredients. It also makes a great topping for traditional Italian pizzas, especially when paired with melty mozzarella, brightly acidic tomato sauce, refreshing basil, and piquant arugula! Serve it alongside a plate of Tuscan tagliatelle and vegetables, or pair it with sauteed fresh asparagus or sweet peas. No matter how you choose to use it, this prosciutto crudo will impart the taste of centuries of Italian culinary tradition into your signature dishes!\nSince his childhood, Fontana Ermes's life has been steeped in the ancient Italian traditions of butchering and curing ham. As a boy, he traveled with his father to remote, rural farms to slaughter hogs for families' winter supplies; because ham was such an important staple in peasant families' diets, this important job had to be carried out with the utmost care and expert skill. As Mr. Ermes became more and more accomplished in the art of butchering, it seemed a natural step for him to begin a ham production facility of his own. In 1959, he began the Fontana Ermes company by curing 17 hams - and, as a testament to his skill, these hams were purchased before they were even finished curing! Today, Fontana Ermes is renowned throughout the world for producing first-class charcuterie and DOP Prosciutto di Parma that are made in their state-of-the art facility with a deep respect for centuries of Italian culinary history. Explore their line of exquisite cured and cooked meats to get a taste of the finest Italy has to offer!"

            "description": "When your customers expect the very best, deliver an entree that's a cut above the rest with this Rastelli's 14 oz. premium bone-in pork cowboy steak! Made from heritage breed Duroc hogs, this pork steak offers luscious flavor and generous, even marbling. Cowboy steak is an extra-thick cut of rib steak with a long french trimmed \"handle\" of rib that gives it rustic appeal. This cut comes from the rib area of the pork loin, a section with plenty of fat marbling for rich flavor and a moderate amount of connective tissue, which helps the cowboy steak maintain its juiciness during the cooking process. Thanks to Rastelli's meticulous butchery standards, this cowboy steak is expertly hand-trimmed for a uniform end result with none of the fat and gristle left behind by grocery store cuts. When cooked to perfection and served alongside tender, fresh vegetables or garlicky mashed potatoes, this show-stopping pork cowboy steak will command attention at your establishment!\nThis cowboy pork steak is a versatile cut of meat that is perfect for a variety of cooking methods. It can be seared, grilled, broiled, baked, or even fried! The versatility of this cut makes it a great addition to your menu. The intact rib bone insulates the meat during cooking, which ultimately helps maintain a temperature that gives a more moist and tender texture to the steak.

Salchichon is a traditional Spanish summer sausage known for its spiced flavor and rich red color. This product is made from the meat of black Iberico hogs, a heritage breed of pig that has been raised in Spain and Portugal for approximately 10,000 years. These pigs roam on lush, green farmland and are fed a diet of acorns that gives their meat a uniquely rich, buttery, delicious flavor. To make this salchichon salami, the butchers at Don Juan hand-select the finest cuts of lean Iberico ham and grind the meat in a large grinder before blending it with salt and an aromatic mix of traditional herbs and spices including nutmeg and black pepper. This mixture is stuffed into natural casings, then tied and left to cure for 3 years. During this curing period, the salami develops a richly complex flavor that prominently features the smooth, distinctive taste of Iberico ham. The curing process doesn't involve the use of added nitrates or nitrates and no preservatives are used in the preparation of this product. The final result is a strikingly red salami encased in a soft white rind that coats the mouth with the rich flavor of centuries of Iberian gastronomic tradition!\nThis Iberico salchichon salami is a perfect addition to a Spanish-inspired tapas cheese plate! Slice the salchichon and serve it alongside other traditional Spanish meats like Serrano ham or chorizo, as well as Spanish cheeses like rich Manchego or distinctive Mahon. Adorn your cheese plate with other Spanish delicacies like salty queen olives, buttery marcona almonds, or sweet quince jelly, and serve alongside a glass of rich Spanish red wine like Rioja or Jumilla - as they nibble and sip, your patrons will feel as though they are being warmed by the rays of the Spanish sun! You can also try substituting this salchichon salami for chorizo in a flavorful paella, or slicing it thin and including it in rich, Spanish-inspired pasta dishes. No matter how you choose to serve it, this Iberico Salchichon salami will make a deliciously traditional addition to your menu!\nSince 1999, Don Juan has been committed to honoring the legacy of traditional Spanish delicacies through careful production using time-honored methods. Each of their products is a love letter to the delicious flavor that comes from pride, careful craftsmanship, and patience.

You can season them with your signature blend of seafood spices to delight your guests with a traditional crack-and-eat presentation, or process them in-house to create specialty dishes like crab cakes or cheesy crab dip. Plus, since this crab is naturally lean and low in calories, it is a healthy accompaniment to any meal. Let their natural, delicate flavor shine and keep your guests coming back for more.\nDungeness crab has a sweet, slightly nutty flavor with tender body meat and leg meat that has a firm texture that makes it easy to shred. They are similar to the rock crab, but larger in size, with 4 legs and a claw. Each cluster is roughly 8 oz. in weight, for a total of approximately 10 clusters per 5 lb. case. These crab clusters are cooked and then shipped frozen to preserve flavor and freshness. They can be served either hot or cold, depending on the needs of your establishment. You can hand your patrons some tools and let them pop open these delicious and hearty clusters themselves, or add the meat to soups, salads, and pasta dishes.\nFor the best results, we recommend broiling, grilling, sauteing, or steaming the crabs.

            "description": "Liven up your menu with an impressive seafood bounty fresh from the Atlantic by serving this Chesapeake Crab Connection fresh lump blue crab claw meat. This premium jumbo lump blue crab meat features exclusively white meat free from shells or cartilage for a tender, supple texture with unrivaled freshness. The fresh meat can be seasoned with a signature blend of seafood spices that will delight your guests. Use it as a foundation for specialty dishes like Maryland crab cakes, cheesy crab dip, or creamy crab bisque. Let the natural, delicate flavor of blue crab shine and keep your guests coming back for more. This crab meat saves you from having to separate the crab meat from the shell, which allows you to spend more time perfecting each meal you serve.\nUnlike crabs caught in areas with milder climates, these blue crabs acclimate their habitats to four distinct seasons throughout the year. This forces these crabs to hibernate and build up fat stores, commonly called \"mustard,\" that are noticeably darker than other blue crab varieties and result in a heartier texture with a sweet, buttery taste. This distinctive flavor, combined with your establishment's signature seasoning blends, makes these crabs a uniquely customized, cherished option on your menu.\nPioneered by a local Maryland crabber turned captain, Chesapeake Crab Connection is the bay lover's choice for blue crabs that are sure to impress. The company offers a variety of both male and female crabs that are true to size standards, guaranteeing the quality and quantity you're looking for to fit your needs. They have over 30 years of experience catching, seasoning, and steaming blue crabs and other premium seafood, as well as preparing seafood specialties such as soups and crab cakes filled with from-scratch flavor. Trust Chesapeake Crab Connection to supply your establishment with the most delectable seafood products to satisfy your guests looking for an authentic Maryland seafood experience."

These premium blue crabs are steamed whole in their shells for a striking presentation with unrivaled freshness. They are boldly spiced with a signature blend of seafood spices that will delight your guests. Serve them as a traditional crack-and-eat presentation, or process them in-house to create specialty dishes like Maryland crab cakes or cheesy crab dip. Let their natural, delicate flavor shine and keep your guests coming back for more.\nThese female Sooks have dense, sweet meat that is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. The mix of small to extra large crabs between 5\" and 7\" are packed with flavor, and a bushel includes 5 to 7 dozen crabs, which is the perfect quantity to feed a large group of people. A general rule of thumb is to have 8 to 12 crabs per person if you are only serving crabs, or 6 crabs per person if you plan to serve other food.\nTo prepare these crabs, fill the base of a large pot with equal parts water, vinegar, and beer, if desired. Place a rack just above water level for the crabs to steam on, and layer the crabs on the rack. Steam the par-cooked crabs for 6-8 minutes, taking care not to dry the meat for optimal succulent texture. There is no recognizable loss of quality from re-steaming.\nUnlike crabs caught in areas with milder climates, these blue crabs acclimate their habitats to four distinct seasons throughout the year. This forces these crabs to hibernate and build up fat stores, commonly called \"mustard,\" that are noticeably darker than other blue crab varieties and result in a heartier texture with a sweet, buttery taste. This distinctive flavor, combined with your establishment's signature seasoning blends, makes these crabs a uniquely customized, cherished option on your menu.\nPioneered by a local Maryland crabber turned captain, Chesapeake Crab Connection is the bay lover's choice for blue crabs that are sure to impress. The company offers a variety of both male and female crabs that are true to size standards, guaranteeing the quality and quantity you're looking for to fit your needs. They have over 30 years of experience catching, seasoning, and steaming blue crabs and other premium seafood, as well as preparing seafood specialties such as soups and crab cakes filled with from-scratch flavor. Trust Chesapeake Crab Connection to supply your establishment with the most delectable seafood products to satisfy your guests looking for an authentic Maryland seafood experience."

The mix of small to extra large crabs between 5\" and 7\" are packed with flavor, and a bushel includes 5 to 7 dozen crabs, which is the perfect quantity to feed a large group of people. A general rule of thumb is to have 8 to 12 crabs per person if you are only serving crabs, or 6 crabs per person if you plan to serve other food.\nTo prepare these crabs, fill the base of a large pot with equal parts water, vinegar, and beer, if desired.

This forces these crabs to hibernate and build up fat stores, commonly called \"mustard,\" that are noticeably darker than other blue crab varieties and result in a heartier texture with a sweet, buttery taste.

            "description": "Bring the bounty of the sea to your tables with these Handy 5 1/4\" jumbo tempura breaded soft shell crabs! In the crystal-clear waters of South East Asia, Mangrove crabs (Scylla Serrata) are expertly raised with size and sustainability in mind. These fat crabs live in floating boxes to avoid contact with the bottom and are fed until it's time for them to naturally molt. Once they shed their hard outer shells, these soft shell crabs are harvested, fully cleaned, individually weighed, lightly coated with crispy tempura batter, and finally flash frozen for freshness. The result is plump crabs with more white meat, large, meaty claw, and an exquisitely crunchy exterior - a gourmet addition to your seafood menu! These soft shell crabs are renowned for their sweet, rich flavor, and tender texture. Because they're meticulously weighed, you can count on consistent sizing from Handy's soft shell crabs for dependable portioning and predictable plate coverage.\nSoft shell crabs are an essential item on your seafood menu. Thanks to their soft shells, every part of the crabs' bodies is edible, so there's no picking required. These popular shellfish are typically a seasonal delicacy, but Handy's Mangrove crabs are available year-round, allowing you to offer this profitable delicacy all the time! These frozen crabs arrive at your door perfectly coated with golden-brown tempura batter. All that's left for you to do is fry and serve! Heat the oil in your deep fryer to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook the crabs belly-side down for 3-4 minutes from thawed or 7-8 minutes from frozen, or until the crabs reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit and have a beautiful, golden-brown appearance! Turn the crabs over once during cooking. You can also bake the crabs in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 14-15 minutes from frozen, turning once during cooking (this method is not recommended for thawed crabs). These crispy tempura-coated crabs are a versatile addition to your menu! Serve them on their own for a satisfying seafood entree, or pair them with a perfectly-seasoned steak to create a delicious surf and turf dinner. You can even use these crabs to create irresistibly crispy soft shell crab sandwiches, or serve them alongside a refreshing vegetable stir fry to add volume and value to your dish! No matter how you choose to serve them, these jumbo tempura breaded soft shell crabs are sure to be a hit on your menu.\nWith a rich company history dating back to 1894, Handy prides itself on being America's oldest seafood processor. A dedication to fresh, authentic ingredients and innovation has allowed the company to continue to grow generation after generation. Leading the way in seafood processing and distribution, Handy is well known for their soft shell crabs, crab meat, and crab cakes. Using technology to their advantage, Handy is the first processor to flash freeze soft shell crabs to provide customers with exceptional quality and freshness. For the best in quality control, the company also uses a black light to remove shells from crab meat while maintaining the product's integrity. Over the years, Handy has expanded their product offering, researched ways to promote sustainability, and celebrated their accomplishments so far while creating a platform for further growth and success.

Lobsters are famously known as a delicacy, and these lobsters are no exception; customers crave this rich, plump, and subtly sweet crustacean. These lobsters are caught in the natural salt waters of Cape Cod, Maine, and Canada, and are shipped live and refrigerated to your establishment for the freshest possible tasting lobster. From there, store them in your front-of-house lobster tank to entice your customers, or store them in a cool, dry place.\nCooking applications for lobsters are wonderfully versatile as lobsters cook well when boiled, broiled, steamed, and grilled. This creates a clean-tasting lobster with a firm and supple texture; these are the ideal characteristics of the protein you want to serve to your customers. Lobsters pair very well with hearty grains that have a definitive bite, such as rice, al dente pasta, or firm barley. Vegetables that enhance the richness from lobster meat vary quite a bit, being able to let the lobster stand out with asparagus, potatoes, green beans, broccoli, or fresh and crispy leafy greens.

            "description": "Whether deep into a hot summer day or midway through a snowy winter, you can serve fresh lobster tails year-round with Boston Lobster Company 16-20 oz. lobster tails. Lobsters are famously known as a delicacy, and these lobster tails are no exception; customers crave this rich, plump, and subtly sweet crustacean. These lobsters are caught in the natural salt waters of Cape Cod, Maine, and Canada, and are shipped frozen to your establishment for the freshest possible tasting lobster. From there, store in freezer bags with as much air removed as possible and place in your freezer.\nLobster tail meat is extremely sought after, giving your customers a plump and firm texture with a subtly sweet taste. Cooking applications for lobster tails are wonderfully versatile as lobsters cook well when boiled, broiled, steamed, and grilled. This creates a clean-tasting lobster with a firm and supple texture; these are the ideal characteristics of the protein you want to serve to your customers. Lobsters pair very well with hearty grains that have a definitive bite, such as rice, al dente pasta, or firm barley. Vegetables that enhance the richness from lobster meat vary quite a bit; asparagus, potatoes, green beans, broccoli, or fresh and crispy leafy greens all let the flavor of the lobster stand out. When selecting fresh herbs, lean more towards balancing varieties such as aromatic tarragon, bright parsley, and comforting thyme. Lobster also pairs excellently with dairy, such as creamy soups and sauces or herb-infused butter. Whatever you pair it with, hit the lobster with a squeeze of lemon to brighten up the subtly sweet and rich meat.\nFor perfectly broiled lobster tails, preheat your broiler and place your lobsters on a baking sheet. Cut a long slit lengthwise along the top side of the lobster's shell and carefully pull shells apart slightly. Brush with a marinade of butter, garlic, lemon, and parsley along the meat and broil lobsters until they are slightly brown and the meat is tender. Adding lobster tails to your dish instantly enhances the overall flavor and appeal of any menu item. Showcase the beautiful lobster tail on its own, or create traditional East Coast-based seafood dishes such as lobster rolls, surf 'n turf, and New England clambake.\nSince 1986, Neil Zarella has been in the lobster business, creating a company that's centered around the East Coast ideology of hard work and dedication to an honest day's labor. Straight from the source where lobsters are famously fresh and abundant, Boston Lobster Company harvests lobsters utilizing a strategic method that supplies the strongest and heartiest lobsters all year-round from their pools located in Nova Scotia. With their headquarters being conveniently situated near Logan International Airport, they're able to distribute their high-quality lobsters within minutes, providing fresh, hard-shell lobsters to businesses everywhere, moving the company to become one of the most sought-after lobster suppliers in the world."

            "description": "Whether deep into a hot summer day or midway through a snowy winter, you can serve fresh lobster claws and knuckles year-round with Boston Lobster Company 12 lb. frozen claw and knuckle lobster meat. Lobsters are famously known as a delicacy, and these lobster claws and knuckles are no exception; customers crave this rich, plump, and subtly sweet crustacean. These lobsters are caught in the natural salt waters of Cape Cod, Maine, and Canada, and are quickly frozen and shipped to your establishment for the freshest possible tasting lobster. From there, store in freezer bags with as much air removed as possible and place in your freezer.\nLobster claw and knuckle meat is extremely tender, offering your customers a melt-in-your-mouth taste and texture. This product is pre-cooked, de-shelled, and sorted based on their cut of meat, which saves you and your employees valuable time, labor expenses, and reduced risk of human error. Boston Lobster Company cooks their lobsters in small batches, ensuring the utmost quality and ideal texture every time. Lobsters pair very well with hearty grains that have a definitive bite, such as rice, al dente pasta, or firm barley. Vegetables that enhance the richness from lobster meat vary quite a bit; asparagus, potatoes, green beans, broccoli, or fresh and crispy leafy greens all let the flavor of the lobster stand out. When selecting fresh herbs, lean more towards balancing varieties such as aromatic tarragon, bright parsley, and comforting thyme. Lobster also pairs excellently with dairy, such as creamy soup and sauces or herb-infused butter. Whatever you pair it with, hit the lobster with a squeeze of lemon to brighten up the subtly sweet and rich meat.\nAdding lobster claws and knuckles to your dish instantly enhances the overall flavor and appeal of any menu item. Lobster claws and knuckles are famously known for the East Coast-based lobster rolls, served in a fluffy, squishy hot dog bun. Try lobster claws and knuckles in traditionally cream-based dishes like mac n cheese, risotto, bisque, and even pot pies. Add lobster meat to crispy and crunchy leafy green salads for a bite of richness, and pair with a light oil vinaigrette, a dairy-based dressing, or with a classic caesar dressing to complement the anchovies. Or, simply showcase the beautiful lobster claws and knuckles on their own, brushing them in a garlic, lemon, and parsley marinade and quickly sauteeing to reheat, and serving with a side of sauteed or roasted vegetables.\nSince 1986, Neil Zarella has been in the lobster business, creating a company that's centered around the East Coast ideology of hard work and dedication to an honest day's labor. Straight from the source where lobsters are famously fresh and abundant, Boston Lobster Company harvests lobsters utilizing a strategic method that supplies the strongest and heartiest lobsters all year-round from their pools located in Nova Scotia. With their headquarters being conveniently situated near Logan International Airport, they're able to distribute their high-quality lobsters within minutes, providing fresh, hard-shell lobsters to businesses everywhere, moving the company to become one of the most sought-after lobster suppliers in the world."

Lobsters are famously known as a delicacy, and these lobster tails are no exception; customers crave this rich, plump, and subtly sweet crustacean. These lobsters are caught in the natural salt waters of Cape Cod, Maine, and Canada, and are shipped refrigerated to your establishment for the freshest possible tasting lobster. From there, you can freeze your lobsters for freshness or store them in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.\nLobster tail meat is extremely sought after, giving your customers a plump and firm texture with a subtly sweet taste. This product is pre-cooked and de-shelled, which saves you and your employees valuable time, labor expenses, and reduced risk of human error. Boston Lobster Company cooks their lobsters in small batches, ensuring the utmost quality and ideal texture every time. Lobsters pair very well with hearty grains that have a definitive bite, such as rice, al dente pasta, or firm barley. Vegetables that enhance the richness from lobster meat vary quite a bit; asparagus, potatoes, green beans, broccoli, or fresh and crispy leafy greens all let the flavor of the lobster stand out. When selecting fresh herbs, lean more towards balancing varieties such as aromatic tarragon, bright parsley, and comforting thyme. Lobster also pairs excellently with dairy, such as creamy soup and sauces or herb-infused butter. Whatever you pair it with, hit the lobster with a squeeze of lemon to brighten up the subtly sweet and rich meat.\nAdding lobster tails to your dish instantly enhances the overall flavor and appeal of any menu item. Lobster is traditionally known in East Coast-based seafood dishes such as lobster rolls, surf 'n turf, and New England clambake. Try lobster in cream-based dishes like mac n cheese, risotto, bisque, and even pot pies. Add lobster meat to crispy and crunchy leafy green salads for a bite of richness, and pair with a light oil vinaigrette, a dairy-based dressing, or with a classic caesar dressing to complement the anchovies. Or, simply showcase the beautiful lobster tail on its own, brushing it in a garlic, lemon, and parsley marinade and quickly sauteeing to reheat, and serve the crustacean with a side of sauteed or roasted vegetables.\nSince 1986, Neil Zarella has been in the lobster business, creating a company that's centered around the East Coast ideology of hard work and dedication to an honest day's labor. Straight from the source where lobsters are famously fresh and abundant, Boston Lobster Company harvests lobsters utilizing a strategic method that supplies the strongest and heartiest lobsters all year-round from their pools located in Nova Scotia. With their headquarters being conveniently situated near Logan International Airport, they're able to distribute their high-quality lobsters within minutes, providing fresh, hard-shell lobsters to businesses everywhere, moving the company to become one of the most sought-after lobster suppliers in the world."

However it's paired, rhubarb provides a smooth, silky texture and zingy taste that's hard to resist!\nAlready precut to save time in the kitchen, this rhubarb is a great way to add a tad of tang to your recipes. Plus, preserved through the IQF, individual quick freezing, process, it's frozen within minutes to prevent ice crystals from forming and watering down the fruit. IQF also helps maintain shape, color, and texture for much longer than typical freezing.

The jam can also be used to fold into meringues for a beautiful swirled effect, and can even be incorporated into buttercream frosting to add a more diverse and unique flavor profile to your cupcakes and cakes! Creating homemade syrup is another wonderful and easy way to use this frozen fruit. Drizzle over waffles, pancakes, and crepes, or fold into yogurt and ricotta for breakfast items. Plus, as a syrup base, this can be added into shaken specialty cocktails for a fun, fruity way to mix things up! With so many creations to be discovered, your next signature menu item will benefit from these IQF sliced apricots.\nWhen fruits are first picked, they start to lose their nutritional value, and freezing in masses lumps the fruit together. Using the IQF method prevents this from happening, and instead keeps the fruit's flavor, structure, nutritional benefits, and natural appearance intact, letting your dishes look and taste their best every time. Thanks to their preservation, the apricots taste deliciously fresh; customers will never guess they were actually frozen!"

Not only do the berries add a tasty twist and pop of color to any recipe, but they are also rich in antioxidants and nutrients like fiber and vitamin C for added nutritional benefits.\nSome operations take advantage of the great taste of cranberries around the holidays by smothering freshly carved turkey with cranberry sauce, jelly, or relish, but they have many other palate pleasing possibilities all year long. They pair great with other fruit, like in a refreshing cranberry orange smoothie. Use them to enhance baked goods like muffins or whip up some oatmeal cranberry cookies or vanilla cranberry scones for unique snacks that are sure to please.\nThese cranberries are preserved through the IQF, individual quick freezing process. This process takes only a few minutes to freeze the food, and this short freeze time prevents ice crystals from forming and watering down your product and also helps the food keep its shape, color, and texture for much longer than typical freezing. It also makes the berries easier to work with since they're in individual pieces rather than a frozen block."

IQF sliced pre-fried plantains are then quickly and individually frozen to maintain their freshness at their best form. Coming conveniently pre-sliced, adding these plantains to your menu allows for so many versatile options, while saving on the cost of labor. When thawed properly, add these plantains into African, Caribbean, and Latin dishes to incorporate a delicious way to add in potassium and fiber that will have customers full and satisfied when leaving your establishment.\nPlantains are an extremely versatile fruit, most commonly sliced on the bias to allow for more surface area when fried in oil to create slightly crispy, deeply golden maduros that can be served warm with sugar or simply finished off with salt. As a variation of maduros, tostones are also fried, then prepared further by being lightly smashed and fried again. Another use for fried plantains is mofongo: mashed, fried plantains that are mixed with garlic paste and pork and served as a side with seafood or salad, or it can be served in a broth-based soup. Offer a popular street food from Ghana by making fried plantains dusted with chili pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg, otherwise known as kelewele, for a crowd-pleasing appetizer. Try your hand at creating traditional aborrajados: fried plantains that are sandwiched around mozzarella cheese, deep fried again, and served like a mini sandwich snack.\nFor a new dish entirely that is usually served morning till night, mangu is a traditional Dominican dish that is simply mashed plantains that are mixed with a bit of butter or oil. Mangu is usually served with pickled red onions on top and is treated as a side to your other main dishes. To utilize plantains in your main dishes, try making an African-inspired stew of plantains, beans, and vegetables for a hearty twist on your daily soup offering. With so many creations to be discovered, your next signature menu item will benefit from these IQF sliced plantains.\nWhen plantains are first picked, they start to lose their nutritional value, and freezing in masses lumps the fruit together. Using the IQF method prevents this from happening, and instead keeps the plantain's flavor, structure, nutritional benefits, and natural appearance intact, letting your dishes look and taste their best every time. Thanks to their preservation, the plantains taste deliciously fresh; customers will never guess they were actually frozen!"

This frozen spinach is picked at the peak of freshness and flash-frozen to preserve its high quality taste, without the use of preservatives. Extremely versatile in application, this spinach is an ideal ingredient for adding greens to virtually any smoothie, creating delectable appetizers like stuffed mushroom caps or spinach and artichoke dip, or a variety of soups, like tuscan white bean and spinach or Italian wedding soup. You can also add to omelets and quiches, or simply serve as a healthy side to your entrees. No matter what it's used for, its soft texture and mild flavor makes this chopped spinach an incredibly valuable ingredient to always have on-hand!\nSpinach is a nutrient powerhouse, containing vitamins and minerals, such as folate, fiber, and iron, as well as carotenoids and flavonoids. Because this spinach is frozen at optimal freshness, it contains more of these essential nutrients than fresh spinach, which is likely to have lost most of its nutrients and folate by the time it reaches your kitchen. Plus, fresh spinach cooks down to a fraction of its original volume, making frozen spinach easier to calculate proportions and a much more economical choice for your establishment. While it does not have to be washed or blanched before use, it is recommended to thaw it in a colander and drain or squeeze dry the amount being used to get as much moisture out as possible before cooking."

Aloe vera is a spiky succulent plant with thick, fleshy green leaves that are tipped with small spines. Inside the leaves is a translucent gel interior that's renowned for its culinary and medicinal uses. Aloe vera gel has very little flavor, though it does have a slight vegetal, \"green\" taste. The gel is loaded with antioxidants and is also a great source of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as calcium and magnesium, making it a wholesome addition to your menu.\nRemoving the tough, spiky exterior of aloe vera leaves is a precise and time-consuming task. Let the experts at Pitaya Foods do the work for you by purchasing these pre-cut aloe vera pieces! This convenient product will save on time and labor costs in your busy kitchen. Plus, it has a wide variety of applications on your menu! Simply blend the gel on its own to create aloe juice, adding cane sugar or fruit juice to cut the vegetal flavor of the aloe if desired. It also makes a healthy and hydrating addition to smoothies! This cut aloe gel makes an attractive and nutritious topping for fruit salads, puddings, or trendy acai bowls.\nHarvested at the peak of ripeness, these versatile aloe vera pieces are conveniently pre-cut and individually quick frozen to maintain their freshness at their best form. When produce is first picked, it starts to lose its nutritional value, and freezing in masses lumps the fruit together. Using the IQF method prevents this from happening, and instead keeps the aloe's flavor, structure, nutritional benefits, and natural appearance intact, letting your dishes look and taste their best every time. Thanks to their preservation, the aloe pieces taste deliciously fresh; customers will never guess they were actually frozen!\nPitaya Foods strives to create the highest quality foods possible with long-lasting health benefits through minimal processing and conscious farming practices. The company is a Certified B Corp, meaning they use ethical business practices that focus on creating positive impacts for their employees, communities, and the environment in addition to profits. They operate out of one of the only solar-powered facilities in Central America, pay their workers above minimum wage, and meet directly with farmers to ensure they are supporting the communities they source their fruit from. Whether you own an eco-friendly or vegan restaurant or are looking to bring more sustainable ingredients onto your menu, Pitaya Foods makes it easy to create high-quality, transparent menu items for your business!"
